1. Still confused about CompareTo. In CompareTo, do we compare Name + Lat Long? If that's the case, wouldn't we handle
returning -1, 0, and +1? Does it return 0 if both the NAME and LATLONG match?
    a. Can I use a Lat Long calculation function that I found in an online resource?

2. In France > Problem, I stored a Hashtable<State, ArrayList<Action>>. When I do a key-value pair access, Does
Hashtable automatically call FrenchCity.hashCode() which is the hash of its String member, NAME?
   would you say that this is a good way of storing the data? or do you have advice for a better way to do so.
        
3. Is the purpose of Node to be used when we build our own Search Tree? In that case, what is the Java
method of keeping track of Node Children and Parents?
